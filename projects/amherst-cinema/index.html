                    <p>
                        Amherst Cinema is an independent, nonprofit movie theater in Amherst, Massachusetts. Going to Amherst 
                        Cinema to watch movies with my friends is always really fun! They have a diverse selection of films, 
                        including independent, foreign, documentary, and classic movies that are incredibly interesting to watch
                        and learn about. Amherst Cinema's special events are also extremely fun events that I love to go to.

                        Recently, I attended a local screening of <em>The Room</em>, a cult classic romantic drama directed by Tommy Wiseau 
                        known as "the worst movie ever made." The event was with a commentary and meet and greet with one of the actors in 
                        the film (Greg Sestero). I thoroughly enjoyed my experience at the theater with my Italian blood orange soda and 
                        nutritional yeast on my popcorn, not to mention the hilarious Q&A and meet and greet with Greg Sestero. However,
                        my experience navigating the Amherst Cinema Website's Home Page was incredibly frustrating. This is why I 
                        chose to redesign the Amherst Cinema Website's Home Page for one of my independent projects for my CS-325: Human 
                        Computer Interaction class.  
                    </p>
                    <hr>
                    <p>
                        For this project, I first designed some user personas. Then, I used Balsamiq to recreate the user experience 
                        for the current design of the home page, examined pain points, and redesigned the home page through a prototype
                        in Balsamiq. Finally, I used Figma to create a high-fidelity prototype of the new design.

                    in Freshman year when her friend group watched <em>The Rocky Horror Picture Show</em> 
                    at Amherst Cinema. Ever since then, she's been going to watch a couple movies a month with her 
                    friend group at Amherst Cinema, mostly cult and horror classics. Olivia usually buys her

                <p><strong>Background:</strong>
                    Miguel was always fascinated by movies ever since he stumbled upon his uncle's copy of 
                    <em>City of God</em>. During his undergrad years, he developed a passion for 
                    film theory and decided to pursue it academically. Now, as a Ph.D. candidate in Film Studies, 
                    he's researching Latin American Cinema. He spends most of his time either in the library or 
                    at academic conferences, and sees Amherst Cinema as a vital resource for his personal passion.
                    He spends time watching and analyzing films independently, but watching 1-2 films each week 
                    at Amherst Cinema is special to Miguel because of the community and because he is a member. 
                    He usually watches films at Amherst Cinema when he wants a break from his thesis, but he 
                    sometimes plans ahead to go to special events.

                <p><strong>Background:</strong>
                    Julia has always been creative, from painting as a child to pursuing photography and mixed media as an adult.
                    After studying visual arts at MassArt, she moved to Northampton to be part of a growing artist community.
                    Julia makes her living through freelance projects, selling prints online, and exhibiting her work in local galleries.
                    As a visual artist, she's drawn to films that push boundaries, either through innovative storytelling, unique cinematography,
                    or experimental techniques. Amherst Cinema is a place where she can find artistic inspiration, attend thought-provoking films,
                    and meet fellow creatives at local events. She likes attending special events/screenings to learn more about the art form,
                    and she likes going to Amherst Cinema to get inspiration for her projects and overcome creative block. Since she goes 
                    to Amherst Cinema frequently, she is considering becoming a member.

                    Robert has lived in South Amherst his whole life and now works at the local Florence Bank. 
                    He and his wife have two young kids, ages 7 and 10, and he enjoys spending weekends finding 
                    ways to entertain and educate them while spending quality time with them. Mark is a big fan 
                    of classic animated films from his own childhood, and some newer titles, and wants to introduce 
                    his kids to a wide variety of movies, from new animated releases to beloved classics. 
                    Amherst Cinema offers family-friendly screenings that appeal to both him and his kids, with 
                    occasional special events like sing-alongs or holiday-themed movies. He doesn't go to Amherst Cinema
                    too frequently, and usually only shows up for the family events.

                        linked twice under the Membership tab and the Support tab. However, the "Parking Tips" is 
                        only linked once on the page, and nowhere on the Navigation Bar. Miguel or Julia would be
                        most likely to support the museum through membership as they are frequent visitors with 
                        disposable income. However, <strong>all of our users would benefit from parking information</strong>, 
                        which means parking information should be more visible than membership information. This is not the 
                        case with the current design.

                    <p>
                        Furthermore, the About Us section contains a mix of information about Amherst Cinema and 
                        logistics such as parking/health/safety information, <strong>linking to 8 different pages</strong>. 
                        This is hard to navigate for all users, leading to potential frustrations.

                    <p class="subheading">Pain Point 3 - Carousel Issues</p>
                    <p>
                        The carousel is <strong>hard to navigate</strong> as it switches images/movies every few seconds,
                        and the only way to go to a specific image/movie is to click on one of the dots. 
                        Users like Robert and Olivia who look for special events can't use this carousel 
                        to view this information. It's <strong>difficult to go to the previous image/movie</strong> because the 
                        dots are very small to click. Lastly, there is also a <strong>negative transfer effect</strong> 
                        because most carousels on websites have arrows to navigate/scroll through the images 
                        which our users may expect.

                    I moved Membership under the new Support Us section, 
                    and added a new Plan Your Visit. This makes Health & Safety 
                    and Parking information more visible for all users, but still lets 
                    Miguel and Julia find Membership information to continue supporting
                    Amherst Cinema. 
                </p>
                <p><strong>Please Note</strong></p>
                <p>
                    I changed the Please Note text into a dismissable alert. This allows users 
                    to acknowledge the alert and continue with their usual workflow.  
                </p>
                <p><strong>Main Home Page Section</strong></p>
                <p>
                    The page has only two columns now to simplify finding information for all of our users.
                    The Playing Today section is the biggest part of website now because Miguel, Julia, and 
                    Olivia like to purchase tickets to movies somewhat impulsively and making this decision 
                    should be the simplest easiest task for them. Comparatively, if our users have more time to spend
                    on the Amherst Cinema website, they can look at the events which are still very visible, despite 
                    not being the biggest part of the website any more. Events can be less visible that the 
                    Playing Today because users would usually spend more time exploring the events, and purchasing
                    event/special screening tickets is usually a less impulsive decision.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    Additionally, I added images for the movies in the Playing Today section. This should help users such as 
                    Miguel, Julia, and Olivia to make quicker decisions about what film they would like to watch today. 
                </p>
                <p><strong>Calendar</strong></p>
                <p>
                    I made the calendar smaller to make space for improved visibility for the Playing Today and 
                    Upcoming In-Person sections, but the calendar is still accessible for users to plan ahead.

                <p>
                    This wireframe shows the home page after a user dismisses the Please Note 
                    alert. As mentioned above, this allows users to acknowledge the alert and 
                    continue with their usual workflow.  
                </p>
                <p><strong>Carousel</strong></p>
                <p>
                    I decreased the height of the carousel to have the "Playing Today" and 
                    "Browse Our Calendar" sections above the fold, increasing their visibility. 
                    This should simplify the process of purchasing movie/event tickets and 
                    viewing showtimes. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I also added arrows and increased the size of the dots on the carousel for 
                    users to easier navigate the carousel images/movies. This should simplify the
                    process of viewing special events.

                    To reduce the complexity of the About Tab and improve visibility of information 
                    users may need to plan their visit, I moved some pages such as Health & Safety 
                    information into a new Plan Your Visit Tab. This reduces the About Tab into only
                    6 links from 8, making finding information much easier for all users. 
                </p>
                <p><strong>Footer</strong></p>
                <p>
                    I removed the sitemap in the Footer because it is redundant with a well organized
                    Navigation Bar. Instead, I shifted some information from the third column of the old 
                    design into the Footer. This preserves having all of the information in the old design 
                    with the benefit of having upcoming events and films playing today being the most visible. 
                    This allows users to fulfill their most important tasks of exploring showtimes/special events, 
                    purchasing tickets, and planning their visit, while still having access to subscribing 
                    to Amherst College's newsletter and donating to Amherst Cinema, for example.

                    I merged the Membership details into one Support Us section. This gives us space for 
                    a Plan Your Visit section, which is important information for all of our users. 
                    I kept Membership/Support details visible by linking those sections in the footer. 
                    This allows Miguel and Julia to continue supporting Amherst Cinema, and Olivia and 
                    Robert to consider supporting Amherst Cinema, without taking up too much space on the 
                    page.

                    in the navigation bar under a new Plan Your Visit section. In the old version of the website, 
                    this information was divided and hard to find. Users had to find some of the information in the 
                    rightmost column, and some in the About section. However, in this design, planning their visit 
                    is much more visible, benefiting all users.

                    Translating from the low-fidelity prototype to a high-fidelity prototype in Figma had some challenges.
                    For example, translating the Balsamiq UI into Figma required designing a color palette. 
                    To design the prototype, I sampled the colors, fonts, and logos from the current website to preserve brand identity.

                    Additionally, building this prototype required building custom components such as a new calendar, 
                    a new carousel, and buttons for the footer in Figma. I matched these components to the current website 
                    as closely as possible. For example, I based the new buttons on the design for the "Subscribe" button for the
                    newsletter, but I bolded the text for improved readability.
