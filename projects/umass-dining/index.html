                <p class="heading">How I Redesigned the UMass Dining App</p>
                <p class="subheading">Project Introduction</p>
                <p>UMass Amherst has held the title for Best College Food for several years with its four incredible dining halls, 
                    numerous cafe locations, and Grab N Go program for when students have to get a quick bite between classes. 
                    To help students find dining hall information, UMass Dining has an app to show students menus, opening hours, busyness, etc. 
                    However, while UMass Dining may be number one, this app is not.</p> 
                <p>Due to my own frustrations, I decided to redesign this app for an independent project for my 
                    CS-325: Human Computer Interaction class. For this redesign, I first designed a user persona for this app. 
                    Then, I built and analyzed wireframes of the current app (to understand pain points), 
                    and built a final prototype using Balsamiq.</p>

                <p class="subheading">User Persona</p>
                <p>To begin this redesign, we have to first understand the status quo. I started
                    by designing a persona based on some interviews with my friends. One persona is 
                    all that is needed for this design because the vast majority of UMass Dining App
                    users is undergraduate students on UMass Dining meal plans.

                        multiple extracurricular activities. Living on campus, Bella relies on UMass Dining
                        for almost all of her meals but sometimes faces struggles managing her time between
                        her classes, her job, and her intramural sports. On the weekends and in the evenings,
                        Bella enjoys grabbing meals with her friends and prioritizes her favorite foods and 
                        locations.</p>

                      <li><strong>Quick Meal Decisions:</strong> <br>Bella needs a quick way to check dining hall menus to make speedy dining decisions.</li>
                      <li><strong>Allergies and Dietary Preferences:</strong> <br>Bella is allergic to shellfish, is experimenting with veganism, and would like to know which dishes align with her preferences.</li>
                      <li><strong>Avoiding Crowds:</strong> <br>Bella wants to avoid long lines during peak meal hours to save time.</li>
                      <li><strong>Menu Information:</strong> <br>Bella wants to know about the menus at the dining halls to know about availability of her favorite foods.</li>

                <p><strong>Pain Point 1 - Notification Settings Alert</strong></p>
                <p>
                    If Bella refuses notifications, the app should not prompt her
                    every time she opens it because it makes using the app inconvenient by
                    adding an extra action to her user flow. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Furthermore, Bella doesn't have a lot of time, so slowing down her journey
                    to access menu information is harmful to her experience and very frustrating.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Pain Point 2 - Poor Dining Hall Organization</strong></p>
                <p>
                    Dining Halls in the app are ordered by busyness from Not Busy to Moderate to Busy by default. 
                    Favorites exist in a different tab. Ideally, Bella would want her favorite dining halls to be the most visible, 
                    even before even the "Not Busy" dining halls on the Open tab. This would reduce the the amount of effort
                    she has to take to get her information. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Taking this idea further, Bella may want to customize how the dining halls are sorted. 
                    For example, she may benefit from seeing which dining halls would be open at some time in the future like a 
                    gap she has between classes. Additionally, she may benefit from sorting dining halls by how close she is to
                    them, to make a better choice about where to grab a quick meal. 
                </p>
                <p><strong>Pain Point 3 - Poor Menu/Info Organization</strong></p>
                <p>
                    Dining Halls open to the Info tab by default. Bella usually uses this app to check menu information more than any other 
                    information about a dining hall. This adds an extra unnecessary step in her user flow, which is especially important
                    due to Bella's limitations on time. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Your Menu and Full Menu pages are more complicated than they need to be. Bella has some dietary preferences, 
                    but to see which dishes match them, she has to view a different page than the Full Menu page that she's likely
                    already on. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Your Menu page would also exclude shellfish and non-vegan options, even though Bella is allergic to 
                    shellfish and only has a preference for vegan meals. Bella may want to know which dishes that have been excluded 
                    are non-vegan and which have shellfish to make better choices about what dishes she would enjoy. For example, 
                    she may want a chicken dish on one day when she's feeling like having something non-vegan, but to see these 
                    dishes in her Your Menu page, she would have to change her preferences.

                            identify favorites). This should also help address Pain Point 2.

                            by replacing the tabs with filters Open Now, Open At, Ignore Favorites, and Sort By. 
                            This adds more customizability to Bella's view of her dining halls and should reduce the
                            complexity of finding a dining hall for Bella, enabling her to 
                            better find the information she needs. This addresses Pain Point 2.  
                        </p>
                        <p><strong>Dining Hall Organization</strong></p>
                        <p>
                            I reorganized the dining halls from sorting by busyness to: 
                            Favorites by Busyness > Non-Favorites by Busyness > Closed Favorites > 
                            Non-Closed Favorites. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This is a more intuitive ordering of the dining halls, and Bella should be able to 
                            easier find her top dining halls, addressing Pain Point 2.

                            Bella can filter for only dining halls open now like the old “Open” tab.
                            This preserves the functionality of the tabs, and continuing to allow 
                            Bella to search for dining halls that are open in the moment.   
                        </p>

                            Bella can filter for only dining halls open at specific times. This allows her
                            to plan ahead rather than just see what's open/closed now. Planning ahead could
                            save her precious time in between events.

                            Bella can click on this button to ignore starred/favorite dining halls when sorting 
                            the dining halls. This option is valuable because it mirrors the old interface's Open 
                            and Closed tabs, allowing old users to keep using the flows that they had for the old 
                            version of the app.

                            Bella can sort dining halls by Busyness (default), Alphabetical, or Distance from her.
                            This adds more customizability but still leaves the default option of sorting by busyness
                            like in the old interface. Sorting Alphabetically could help Bella find a specific hall/cafe 
                            and sorting by Distance could help Bella make a choice about where she can get a meal 
                            the fastest.

                            As can be seen below, the Your Menu and Full Menu pages were consolidated. 
                            Now, Bella can update dietary preferences in this menu on the home page and they will be
                            reflected in all the menus across all the dining halls. This should make it more 
                            convenient for Bella to change her preferences.

                            I fixed the unnecessary segregation of the Full Menu and Your Menu tabs 
                            to simplify it into one tab.

                            This tab is also now the default tab (instead of
                            the Info tab) because Bella would usually use this app only to get 
                            menu information. This makes getting that information as easy as clicking 
                            on a dining hall - just one click, addressing Pain Point 3.

                            To make clear which dishes do not match Bella's dietary preferences, 
                            I grayed them out and highlighted the allergen/ingredient(s) that do not match 
                            with the preferences in red. This should make it clear which allergens/ingredients 
                            are responsible for being incompatible with Bella's dietary preferences, addressing 
                            Pain Point 3.
