                    ThorGPT was my final group project for my CS-320: Software Engineering class. 
                    Our task was to build a RAG LLM for ISO New England, corporation that manages 
                    the electricity supply for New England. This LLM is to help users like ISO New
                    England employees and contractors easily search for rules, procedures, and documents.
                    I was responsible for building the frontend in React, designing the UI, updating 
                    documentation, and collaborating on the architecture for our project. However, this 
                    page will focus on the design process for developing the UI which I conducted 
                    independently.

                    I started this design process by collaborating with ISO New England to 
                    develop a user persona. Through our dialogue, we came up with the persona 
                    of Joe, a solar panel contractor including his goal and frustrations.

                    Based on the user persona that we came up with, we identified two 
                    main design considerations to use when designing our prototypes. 
                    <ol>
                        <li>Transfer Effect</li>
                        <ul>

                                Joe has probably used other LLMs such as ChatGPT or 
                                Microsoft Copilot which have similar UIs
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                For example, they share a dark colored background and 
                                the main text input anchored to the bottom of the page
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Our design should be similar enough to other LLMs to 
                                fit users' intuitions
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <li>Simplicity</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Joe's main frustration with the current search for 
                                answers is that it is complex and tedious to search 
                                for the right section in the right document
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Our design should aim to be as simple to use as 
                                possible to solve this problem
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                We may do this by having only one frontend page 
                            </li>

                    Using the design considerations and user persona, I came up with
                    two low-fidelity UI prototypes for ThorGPT using Balsamiq. Below 
                    is my first prototype. 
                    <img class="prototype" src="images/Wireframe 1.png"> 
                    The home page has eight common engineered prompts available to 
                    choose from. A user can also type their own prompt in the prompt 
                    bar on the bottom and click on the send button to get an answer. 
                    The prompt bar also has a button that links to the ISO New England 
                    website, and a help button that helps users learn how to use ThorGPT.

                    This wireframe shows the UI when a user types in or chooses a prompt. 
                    The user prompt is shown on the top right and the AI response is on the 
                    left. The response also shows an embedded PDF that was used to answer 
                    the prompt.

                    I analyzed both of these prototypes to combine the best features 
                    for a final prototype. From Prototype 1, I chose to use icons 
                    for the ISO New England website and help pages in the prompt bar. 
                    This results in less text crowding the page, simplifying the main 
                    functionality.

                    From Prototype 2, I chose the linked PDFs instead of the embedded 
                    PDFs. This option offers users the most flexibility in viewing the 
                    PDFs as they can view the PDFs on their devices/browser, or 
                    download and view locally. I also chose the three groups of 
                    engineered prompts instead of the eight prompts because three groups 
                    of common prompts is simple enough to be useful to users who have 
                    common questions.

                    After analyzing my two initial prototypes, I combined the best features

                    I took this final design back to ISO New England during our weekly
